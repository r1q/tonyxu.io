**Problem-solving** skill is the most important skill at work, you need to think about:

- If you are not good at solving problem
- How to improve the problem-solving skill

Look back to the two years working at [Moxtra](https://www.moxtra.com), the fundamental job I do is to solve problem, given that i'm a *Solution Engineer*. And the problem is basically:

- I have problem A, do you have solution B?

In most cases, I will evaluate based on these aspects:

- Do we have existing solution
- If we need to support, does it align with our product road map or position
- Do it have positive impact on the business and revenue

If any of them is *No*, we might just say *No* to customer. This seems to be right, and avoid potential waste of effort. But if you take a deeper look at it, there are always something we can do, given that I'm a *Solution Engineer*.

For example:

- Understand more about the use cases, make sure if *problem A* is valid
- Understand more about the problem, and see if there are better solution other than *solution B*

The key is to look at the problem with the objective of solving it, rather than simply say Yes/No, and then push back responsibility to others.
