Later when I'm a freshman in college, I built a website for fun and subscribed shared hosting online. However, I found out that shared hosting has too many restrictions such as you have no control over softwares, so I switched to VPS. I also deployed some instances in AWS for the course project when I'm studying in University of Missouri for master's. After graduation, I tried Heroku as well, for running small demo apps. Although I'm not expert in cloud computing, I had some experiences and knows something about it.</p> <p><a href="/posts/2018/cloud-computing-exploration/">Read article</a></p></div><div><h3><a href="/posts/2018/create-alfred-workflow-for-uploading-screenshot-to-s3/">Create Alfred workflow for uploading screenshot to S3</a></h3> <p>As Markdown markup language gets more and more popular, most people have a need to quickly generate a public url for screenshot/image in clipboard.
